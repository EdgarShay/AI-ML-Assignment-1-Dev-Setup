# AI-ML Assignment 1 - Iris Flower Dataset Exploration


# Project Goal
The goal of this assignment is to establish a functional development environment for Machine Learning, 
demonstrate proficiency with essential Python libraries, and apply basic data exploration and visualization 
techniques to understand the Iris Flower Dataset.

# Environment Setup
Python
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
scikit-learn

# How to Run
Open the IRIS-Analysis.ipynb notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
2.Run each cell sequentially to see the outputs.
3. Visualizations will be displayed inline.

 
# Data Exploration & Visualizations

Histogram: Displays the distribution of petal length.
Box Plot: Shows the distribution of petal length grouped by species, highlighting differences and potential outliers.
Scatter Plot: Compares petal length and width, colored by species to visualize separability.
Correlation Matrix: Shows how numerical features relate to each other.
Pair Plot: Displays all feature relationships and separability between species.

# Key Findings
Petal length and petal width are the most discriminative features for separating species.
Setosa is clearly separable from Versicolor and Virginica.
Sepal length and width show more overlap and are less discriminative.
Dataset has no missing values and is ready for modeling.
